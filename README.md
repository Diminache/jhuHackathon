Hello Everyone!
This Hackathon project was created by Daanish Bawan, Tahir Ismailwala, and Waleed Raza at the John Hopkins Hackathon. 


The tools we used were: chatGPT API, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, WebSpeechKit library, and Google Cloud.
The main point of this project was to create a project to help marginalized communities like the blind, illiterate, and dissabled, in overcoming communication barriers in the medical industry. 

We had two mian functionalities in this project. 
The first functionality would allow the user to record their conversation with their doctor and it would "dumb down" the conversation they had allowing the user to understand what the doctor said.
The second functionality was a chat bot. This chat bot allowed the user to have a consultation with an Ai. Guiding the user to self diagnose themselves, allowing them to know the severity of their health and the importance of going to a doctor.
